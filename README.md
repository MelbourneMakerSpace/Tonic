**Prerequisites Setup**

1.  Install Node.js. Choose the LTS option.

2.  Open VS Code. Open a terminal with `Ctrl + ~`

3.  `cd` to your base programming projects folder. When you clone it will create a new Tonic folder here.

4.  Clone the tonic project from git:

`git clone https://github.com/MelbourneMakerSpace/Tonic.git`

5.  `cd` to the base github folder/Tonic.

6.  `npm install -g @angular/cli`

7.  `npm install`
    (That will fetch and install the packages listed in the project's package.json file.)

8.  `ng serve` (This will transpile the code and start up a web server on port 4200.)

Visit http://localhost:4200 to see the web app.
